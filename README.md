# Baby Bird

This is a passion project I've been working on in the background during my coding bootcamp.

It is a work-in-progress skydiving logbook that will allow me to access information about all of my past skydives in meaaningfully organized ways.

I'm currently working towards having a functional CLI but have dreams of building an API and implementing a prettier GUI in the future.
